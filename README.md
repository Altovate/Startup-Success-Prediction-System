# Classify startup



## Usage



## Developing
In this project we make a predictive analysis to improve the decision making of the venture 
capitalists on their investments to be made on the startups. Using various classification 
methods, we here try to make a prediction considering various factors like startup locations, 
funding rounds, category, status and so on. Using these locations the prediction based system 
will suggest the venture capitalist if the startup he wants to invest on will go bankrupt or not 
in the near future. The test dataset which is used in this project is based on the crunch base 
API. Analysis is performed using various methods like Linear Regression, Logical 

Regression, Decision tree, KNN method.
